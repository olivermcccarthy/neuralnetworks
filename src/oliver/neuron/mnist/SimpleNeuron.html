Each Neuron calculates an output based on its inputs and weights using the Sigmoid function. This shows how a neural network can be trained to recognize hand written digits.  
<br>

This jar contains all the training digits from the "http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/" mnist training set  (60000 plus images).
It know the expected output for each image. So we use this info to train our network. One pass through the network is 
referred to as one run.  
 
<li> This Network has 28*28 inputs Neurons one for each pixel in the input image. Each of these input Neurons is connected to a hidden neuron (These links are not shown). 
<li> Each hidden neuron is connected to each output Neuron. 
<li> In neural networks each connection has a weight. Here we cant show all actual weights so we paint a picture of the weights ranging from most positive(Red) to most Negative(Dark Blue).
 
<li> For each trial an input image is loaded and  passed through the network
<ul>
<li> Each Neuron in the hidden layer calculates its output based on input*weight. 
<li> Then each Neuron in the output layer calculates its output based on input(output from hidden Layer)*weight. 
<li> If output 3 is the highest then network is telling us the digit is 3. So we then need to train the network by passing it the expected value.
<li> But we know the digit should be 5. 
<li> Each Neuron in the output layer is passed the expected value (1 to neuron 5, 0 to all other Neurons). As in we expected 1 at output neuron 5 and 0 at other neurons
<li> Each output Neuron adjusts its weights(A tiny bit) based on this expected value.
<li> Then each Neuron in the hidden layer adjusts its weights.
<ul>   
<li> And thats just one trial. 
<li> For the Network to learn with any degree of accuracy we would need to run 100000 trials.

 You can watch as the Network Learns And see it getting better at predicting the digit
