Train a network to recogize hadn written digits from the mnist training set 
The network learns each time a digit is passed through as we know the expected digit for each image
The input image contains 28*28 pixels.  
784 input Neurons that are connected to each of the Hidden Neurons 
  Each of the Hidden Neurons is connected to each of the output Neurons
Weights are shown in a sqaure. Red for positive weights,blue for negative weights 
Watch as the weights change color as the network learns 
It will take many iterations for teh nwtrok to learn with any degree of accuracy.
 Set Batch size to 10000 and run through X number of batches
Watch as the number of wrong digits decreases per batch
